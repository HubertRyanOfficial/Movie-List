# Movies List

In this project you will have a list of films with details, pulling data from the films such as poster, plot, how many people are watching a specific film using the Trakt API and managing the state of the application with Redux, obtaining data from the API with Axios and with styling more detailed using Style-Components.

By Hubert Ryan.

### About

Using the Trakt API to make the call with Axios, receiving all the movie ids, another Api flame was made together called OMDB to obtain the images (Posts) of each specific film. Two connections were created with Axios to be able to access the Trakt and OMDB API explained in the previous paragraph.

### Tests

To perform some unit tests, the Jest library was used to solve the stock tests used in Redux together with the reducers.
